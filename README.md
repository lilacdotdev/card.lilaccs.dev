# Card.LilacCS.Dev
## Use Case
The use case for this site is for others to be able to quickly find all my socials and contacts at a glance. It's merely a way for me to quickly be able to connect with people in any manner they prefer.

## Execution
Due to not needing any of the back-end polish, the stack for this static website will just be a very simple vite/react/tailwind. That's it! I could do it in raw html and css, but I'm trying to practice react and tailwind so I'm going to use that.

## Actions
I'm using Github Actions to build this project upon PR into main. I'll be creating this app on the dev branch, and pr into main to build it. From here, all I have to do is just copy paste the files into my server's filesystem under the subdomain, and I'm good to go!
